Promatranje ljudi na željezničkom kolodvoru,People-Watching in a Train Station,monologue,A2,"Jučer sam čekao vlak na željezničkom kolodvoru i imao sam mnogo vremena. Sjeo sam na klupu i počeo promatrati ljude oko sebe. Bilo je zanimljivo vidjeti koliko su svi različiti. Jedna obitelj je imala puno kofera i djeca su bila vrlo glasna. Mladi par je sjedio blizu i razgovarao tiho. Vidio sam i starijeg gospodina koji je čitao novine i mirno pio kavu. Neki ljudi su trčali jer nisu htjeli zakasniti na vlak, a drugi su stajali i gledali na sat. Promatranje ljudi mi je bilo zabavno jer svaka osoba ima svoju priču, a kolodvor je mjesto gdje se te priče na kratko sretnu.","Yesterday I waited for a train at the station and had a lot of time. I sat on a bench and started watching the people around me. It was interesting to see how different everyone was. One family had many suitcases and the children were very loud. A young couple sat nearby and spoke quietly. I also saw an older man who was reading a newspaper and calmly drinking coffee. Some people were running because they didn’t want to miss the train, and others stood still and looked at the clock. Watching people was fun because each person has their own story, and the station is a place where those stories meet for a short moment."
Jedan dan u knjižnici,A Day at the Library,monologue,A2,"Jučer sam proveo cijelo prijepodne u knjižnici. Došao sam rano jer sam htio naći mirno mjesto za učenje. Knjižnica je velika i tiha, s mnogo stolova i polica punih knjiga. Prvo sam posudio jednu knjigu o povijesti i jednu knjigu na engleskom jeziku. Zatim sam sjeo za stol i čitao nekoliko sati. Oko mene su studenti učili i pisali zadaće. Ponekad je netko došao pitati knjižničarku za pomoć, ali većinom je bilo vrlo mirno. U pauzi sam otišao do kafića u blizini, popio kavu i vratio se. Na kraju dana vratio sam knjige na policu i otišao kući zadovoljan jer sam puno naučio.","Yesterday I spent the whole morning in the library. I came early because I wanted to find a quiet place to study. The library is big and quiet, with many tables and shelves full of books. First I borrowed a book about history and a book in English. Then I sat at a table and read for several hours. Around me, students were studying and writing homework. Sometimes someone came to ask the librarian for help, but most of the time it was very quiet. During the break I went to a café nearby, drank coffee, and returned. At the end of the day I put the books back on the shelf and went home satisfied because I had learned a lot."
Prevladavanje jezične barijere,Overcoming a Language Barrier,monologue,B2,"Kada sam prvi put živio u inozemstvu, najveći problem za mene bila je jezična barijera. Znao sam nekoliko osnovnih riječi, ali nisam mogao izraziti ono što stvarno mislim ili osjećam. Na početku sam se često osjećao izgubljeno i isključeno iz razgovora. Međutim, s vremenom sam shvatio da je jedini način da prevladam tu prepreku – riskirati i govoriti, čak i kada nisam siguran u točnost. Počeo sam postavljati jednostavna pitanja, tražiti objašnjenja i koristiti geste. Ljudi su uglavnom bili strpljivi i spremni pomoći, a ja sam polako stjecao samopouzdanje. Posebno mi je pomoglo kada sam pronašao prijatelje koji nisu kritizirali moje pogreške, nego su me poticali da nastavim pokušavati. Nakon nekoliko mjeseci primijetio sam da razgovaram prirodnije i da više ne razmišljam o svakoj riječi. Shvatio sam da je jezična barijera stvarna samo dok je sami gradimo. Kada prihvatimo nesavršenost i damo si vremena, komunikacija postaje moguća i odnosi se mogu graditi bez obzira na savršenstvo jezika.","When I first lived abroad, the biggest problem for me was the language barrier. I knew a few basic words, but I couldn’t express what I really thought or felt. At the beginning I often felt lost and excluded from conversations. However, over time I realized that the only way to overcome this obstacle was to take the risk and speak, even when I wasn’t sure about accuracy. I started asking simple questions, requesting explanations, and using gestures. People were generally patient and willing to help, and I slowly gained confidence. It especially helped when I found friends who didn’t criticize my mistakes but encouraged me to keep trying. After a few months I noticed that I was speaking more naturally and no longer thinking about every word. I realized that the language barrier exists only as long as we build it ourselves. When we accept imperfection and give ourselves time, communication becomes possible and relationships can be built regardless of perfect language."
Moj dom,My Home,monologue,A1,"Moj dom je mali, ali lijep. U njemu imam dnevnu sobu, kuhinju, kupaonicu i spavaću sobu. U dnevnoj sobi je stol, stolice i televizija. Kuhinja je svijetla i u njoj kuham hranu. U spavaćoj sobi je krevet i ormar. U kupaonici je ogledalo i tuš. Moj dom ima prozore i vrata, a ispred kuće je malo dvorište. Volim svoj dom jer je topao i udoban.","My home is small but nice. It has a living room, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. In the living room there is a table, chairs, and a television. The kitchen is bright and I cook food in it. In the bedroom there is a bed and a wardrobe. In the bathroom there is a mirror and a shower. My home has windows and doors, and in front of the house there is a small yard. I love my home because it is warm and comfortable."
Moj kvart,My Neighborhood,monologue,A1,"Moj kvart je miran i lijep. U kvartu su kuće, stanovi i trgovine. Blizu moje kuće je škola i mala pekarnica. Ima i park gdje djeca igraju nogomet i ljudi šeću pse. Ulica je duga i ima mnogo stabala. Ponekad idem u trgovinu ili pijem kavu u kafiću na uglu. Moj kvart nije velik, ali je ugodan i svi se ljudi poznaju.","My neighborhood is quiet and nice. In the neighborhood there are houses, apartments, and shops. Near my home there is a school and a small bakery. There is also a park where children play football and people walk dogs. The street is long and has many trees. Sometimes I go to the shop or drink coffee in the café on the corner. My neighborhood is not big, but it is pleasant and everyone knows each other."
Moj razred,My Classroom,monologue,A1,"Moj razred je velik i svijetao. U razredu imamo mnogo stolova i stolica. Na zidu je ploča i sat. Učitelj piše na ploči, a mi učenici slušamo. U razredu su i knjige, bilježnice i olovke. Prozor je velik, a kroz prozor vidimo školu i drveće. Ponekad je razred tih, a ponekad bučan. Volim svoj razred jer učim mnogo novih stvari i igram se s prijateljima.","My classroom is big and bright. In the classroom we have many tables and chairs. On the wall there is a board and a clock. The teacher writes on the board and we students listen. In the classroom there are also books, notebooks, and pencils. The window is large, and through the window we see the school and the trees. Sometimes the classroom is quiet, and sometimes noisy. I love my classroom because I learn many new things and play with friends."
Putovanje sam u Hrvatskoj,Traveling Alone in Croatia,monologue,A2,"Prošlog ljeta putovao sam sam po Hrvatskoj. Bilo je uzbudljivo, ali i malo teško jer sam sve morao organizirati sam. Prvo sam bio u Zagrebu, gdje sam posjetio muzeje i šetao starim gradom. Nakon toga otišao sam vlakom u Split. Tamo sam uživao u moru, suncu i starim rimskim zidinama. Svaki dan sam upoznavao nove ljude, neki su bili turisti, a neki lokalni stanovnici. Ponekad sam se osjećao usamljen, ali često sam bio sretan jer sam imao slobodu birati kamo idem i što radim. Putovanje sam mi je pokazalo da mogu biti neovisan i da Hrvatska ima mnogo lijepih mjesta za istraživanje.","Last summer I traveled alone in Croatia. It was exciting, but also a little difficult because I had to organize everything by myself. First I was in Zagreb, where I visited museums and walked through the old town. After that I went by train to Split. There I enjoyed the sea, the sun, and the old Roman walls. Every day I met new people, some were tourists and some were local residents. Sometimes I felt lonely, but often I was happy because I had the freedom to choose where I went and what I did. Traveling alone showed me that I can be independent and that Croatia has many beautiful places to explore."
Priprema za ispit,Preparing for an Exam,monologue,A2,"Sljedeći tjedan imam važan ispit i zato svaki dan učim. Ujutro pijem kavu i čitam bilješke iz škole. Zatim rješavam stare zadatke i ponavljam teške riječi. Ponekad idem u knjižnicu jer tamo mogu mirno raditi bez buke. Kada se umorim, napravim kratku pauzu i prošetam vani. Moj plan je učiti tri sata ujutro i dva sata navečer. Najviše se bojim gramatike, pa je ponavljam svaki dan. Znam da je priprema duga i ponekad dosadna, ali vjerujem da ću uspjeti ako radim redovito.","Next week I have an important exam, so I study every day. In the morning I drink coffee and read notes from school. Then I solve old exercises and repeat difficult words. Sometimes I go to the library because there I can work quietly without noise. When I get tired, I take a short break and walk outside. My plan is to study three hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. I am most afraid of grammar, so I repeat it every day. I know that preparation is long and sometimes boring, but I believe I will succeed if I work regularly."
Sunčev sustav,The Solar System,science,A1,"Sunčev sustav je veliki prostor u svemiru. U središtu je Sunce. Oko Sunca kruže planeti. Najbliži planet je Merkur, a zatim Venera, Zemlja i Mars. Poslije su Jupiter, Saturn, Uran i Neptun. Neki planeti imaju mjesece. Zemlja ima jedan mjesec. U Sunčevom sustavu ima i mnogo zvijezda, kamenja i leda. Sunčev sustav je naš dom u svemiru.","The Solar System is a large space in the universe. In the center is the Sun. Around the Sun move the planets. The closest planet is Mercury, then Venus, Earth, and Mars. After them are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Some planets have moons. Earth has one moon. In the Solar System there are also many stars, rocks, and ice. The Solar System is our home in the universe."
Sushi,Sushi,food,A1,"Sushi je japansko jelo. On se pravi od riže, ribe i povrća. Ponekad sushi ima i jaje ili alge. Sushi može biti sirov ili kuhan. U Japanu ljudi često jedu sushi, ali i u drugim državama je popularan. Sushi se jede štapićima ili rukom. Mnogi ljudi vole sushi jer je ukusan i zdrav.","Sushi is a Japanese dish. It is made from rice, fish, and vegetables. Sometimes sushi has egg or seaweed. Sushi can be raw or cooked. In Japan people often eat sushi, but it is also popular in other countries. Sushi is eaten with chopsticks or with the hand. Many people like sushi because it is tasty and healthy."
Moje jutarnje putovanje,My Morning Commute,monologue,A1,"Svako jutro idem na posao. Ustajem rano i doručkujem kod kuće. Zatim idem na autobus. Autobus dolazi u sedam sati. U autobusu vidim mnogo ljudi. Neki ljudi čitaju, a neki razgovaraju. Ja obično gledam kroz prozor ili slušam glazbu. Put traje oko trideset minuta. Kada stignem, izlazim iz autobusa i idem pješice do posla. Moje jutarnje putovanje je jednostavno i mirno.","Every morning I go to work. I get up early and eat breakfast at home. Then I go to the bus. The bus comes at seven o’clock. On the bus I see many people. Some people read, and some talk. I usually look out the window or listen to music. The trip takes about thirty minutes. When I arrive, I get off the bus and walk to work. My morning commute is simple and calm."
Politički sustavi u svijetu,Political Systems of the World,politics,A1,"U svijetu postoje različiti politički sustavi. Neke države imaju demokraciju. U demokraciji ljudi glasaju i biraju vladu. Druge države imaju kralja ili kraljicu. To se zove monarhija. Neke države imaju predsjednika, a neke premijera. U nekim državama ljudi nemaju izbor. Politički sustavi su različiti, ali cilj je upravljati državom.","In the world there are different political systems. Some countries have democracy. In a democracy people vote and choose the government. Other countries have a king or a queen. This is called a monarchy. Some countries have a president, and some have a prime minister. In some countries people have no choice. Political systems are different, but the goal is to govern the country."
Učenje novog jezika,Learning a New Language,monologue,B1,"Učenje novog jezika za mene je uvijek izazov, ali i velika prilika. Kada počnem učiti, osjećam se kao da otvaram vrata u novi svijet. Na početku je teško jer ne razumijem mnogo riječi i često se sramim govoriti. Ipak, svaki dan učim malo više i osjećam napredak. Pomaže mi kada gledam filmove s titlovima ili slušam glazbu na tom jeziku. Također pokušavam razgovarati s ljudima, iako pravim pogreške. Mislim da su pogreške važan dio procesa, jer kroz njih najbolje učimo. Ponekad izgubim motivaciju, ali onda se sjetim zašto sam počeo: želim putovati, bolje razumjeti kulturu i možda jednoga dana raditi u drugoj zemlji. Učenje jezika traži vrijeme i strpljenje, ali nagrada je osjećaj da se povezujem s ljudima na nov način.","Learning a new language is always a challenge for me, but also a big opportunity. When I start learning, I feel like I am opening the door to a new world. At the beginning it is hard because I don’t understand many words and I am often shy to speak. Still, every day I learn a bit more and feel progress. It helps me when I watch movies with subtitles or listen to music in that language. I also try to talk with people, even though I make mistakes. I think mistakes are an important part of the process, because through them we learn best. Sometimes I lose motivation, but then I remember why I started: I want to travel, understand the culture better, and maybe one day work in another country. Learning a language takes time and patience, but the reward is the feeling that I connect with people in a new way."
